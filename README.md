# Getting Started

## Cloning the repository

First, you have to clone the project into local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/JohnDoeAntler/LF2-AI-Abstraction.git
```

Or you could just download the repository by clicking on the top right "Clone" button to download the entire template.

## Installing the custom ddraw.dll

As LF2 AngelScript Engine 2.2 doesn't support array sorting and LF2 AngelScript Engine 2.3.1 has the wrong offset of the catch timer.
Therefore, I self-compiled a custom ddraw.dll with supporting array sorting and correct ctimer offset. The download link is available in the release page.

# Examples

Please check out the repository wiki page.

# Todo-List

1. Improve the accuracy of prediction.
2. Add on ground prediction.
