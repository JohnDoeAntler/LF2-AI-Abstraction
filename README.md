# Getting Started

## Cloning the repository

First, you have to clone the project into local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/JohnDoeAntler/LF2-AI-Abstraction.git
```

Or you could just download the repository by clicking on the top right "clone" button to [download](https://github.com/JohnDoeAntler/LF2-AI-Abstraction/archive/master.zip) the entire template.

## Installing the custom ddraw.dll

As LF2 AngelScript Engine 2.2 doesn't support array sorting and LF2 AngelScript Engine 2.3.1 has the wrong offset of the catch timer.
Therefore, I self-compiled a custom ddraw.dll with supporting array sorting and correct ctimer offset. The download link is available in the [release page](https://github.com/JohnDoeAntler/LF2-AI-Abstraction/releases/tag/0.0.1).

# Examples

# Todo-List

1. Improve the accuracy of prediction.
2. Add on ground prediction.
